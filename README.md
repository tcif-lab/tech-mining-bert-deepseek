## üß† Overview

Humanoid robotics is rapidly advancing, driven by the convergence of multimodal AI, advanced mechatronics, and human-robot interaction technologies. This project proposes a hybrid technology mining framework to compare and analyze innovation trajectories across **closed-source (patents)** and **open-source (GitHub)** ecosystems.

We employ:
- **BERTopic** for topic extraction from patent abstracts and GitHub+Huging Face README files.
- **DeepSeek-V3** for explainable reclassification into technological functions.

The study reveals distinct patterns in innovation models, demonstrating how proprietary and collaborative ecosystems drive innovation differently in the humanoid robotics domain.

## üìÅ Code Structure

The repository includes the following core notebooks:

### `1. EDA.ipynb`
- Initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the retrieved patent and GitHub+Hugging Face datasets.
- Includes preprocessing, filtering based on quality metrics (e.g., stars > 10 on GitHub), and statistical visualization of trends over time.
- Key visualizations: publication counts by year, geospatial trends, citation/star distribution.

### `2. BERT+DeepSeekV3.ipynb`
- Implements a BERTopic pipeline to extract semantically coherent clusters of innovation topics from patent and GitHub corpora.
- Uses DeepSeek-V3 for reclassification of extracted topics into four major technical categories: **Actuators, Brains, Sensors, Batteries**.
- Includes explainable AI integration and results interpretation using both intrinsic and extrinsic validation.

## üìä Key Contributions

- **Novel comparative framework**: Enables cross-source mining between structured (patent) and unstructured (open-source) data.
- **Temporal & geographic innovation mapping**: Shows bursts of development aligned with milestones in AI and robotics (e.g., Atlas launch, GPT/ROS releases).
- **Open-source vs. Patent divergence**: 
  - Patents: hardware, control circuits, mobility, protected innovations.
  - GitHub+Hugging Face: cognitive models, simulations, software middleware.
